### README for In-house News Analytics Software and Market Predictor

---

#### Project Overview
This repository contains the codebase for an in-house developed software aimed at performing advanced news analytics and market prediction. The software suite includes modules for Keyword Extraction, Entity Recognition, Domain Classification, News Summarization, and Sentiment Scoring. This innovative tool leverages machine learning and natural language processing to drive financial analytics and forecasting.

#### Features

- **Keyword Extractor**: Automatically identifies and extracts significant keywords from financial news articles.
- **Entity Extractor**: Utilizes NLP to recognize and categorize proper nouns in text, aiding in identifying major stakeholders.
- **Domain Classifier**: Classifies news articles into relevant categories (e.g., Business vs. General), improving data relevancy and filtering capabilities.
- **News Summarizer**: Generates concise summaries from lengthy articles, focusing on key information and insights.
- **News Sentiment Scorer**: A hybrid model combining a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and a lexicon-based semi-supervised approach to accurately gauge the sentiment conveyed by news articles.

#### Performance and Strategy
The system implements several trading strategies based on the sentiment scores derived from news articles. These include:
- **Alpha Indices Creation**: Utilizes moving averages of sentiment scores to develop indices that aim to outperform volatile markets by delivering higher returns at reduced risk levels.
